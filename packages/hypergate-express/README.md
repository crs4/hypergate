# hypergate-express
hypergate-express is built on top of [Express](http://expressjs.com)
and can be used to create a web service to interact  with a hypergate instance usign a REST interface.
Hypergate commands can be triggered with POST requests made to `/command/{hypergate command}` with the command 
payload inside the request body. Hypergate events can be read with GET requests made to `/event/{hypergate event}`. 
For each type of event only the data of the last event is available. The response object of the GET request contains two attributes:

* `data`: payload of the event
* `date`: Number of milliseconds from 01 January, 1970 of the event time in UTC
