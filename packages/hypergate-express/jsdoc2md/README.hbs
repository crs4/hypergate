and can be used to create a web service to interact  with a hypergate instance usign a REST interface.
Hypergate commands can be triggered with POST requests made to `/command/{hypergate command}` with the command

For each type of event only the data of the last event is available. The response object of the GET request contains two attributes:

* `data`: payload of the event
* `date`: Number of milliseconds from 01 January, 1970 of the event time in UTC
